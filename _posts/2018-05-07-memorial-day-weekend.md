### When

Reservation on the site lasts from Friday 5/25 until Tuesday 5/29. Come and go as you please. Heather and I plan arriving on Friday.

### Where

Lake Spaulding Campground [(additional detail here)](https://www.alllaketahoe.com/lakes_rivers_falls/lake_spaulding.php)

Campground is located just a short drive off of highway 80 about 30 miles west of Truckee. We are in site 2.

Directions can be found here [here](https://goo.gl/maps/FZ9wpkudY772)

### Additional details

-Check-in is 2pm, check out is 11am

-Quiet hours are from 10:00pm to 8:00am

-I've paid for the site and one vehicle. I suspect that each additional vehicle will be subject to the day use fee of $7

-Domestic pets are allowed for a fee . Pets must be on a lead at all times.
